## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to provide visualizations of several different aspects from the large data sets for potential investors to understand the success of the NYC CitiBike system and to see if a bike sharing system in Des Moines would be successful. Through the visualizations, we showed the relationships between: checkout times for users by gender, trips by weekday per hour and by gender, relationships of the user types that are utilizing the CitiBike system, start & end locations, and more. 

## Results
Our first visualization showed the relationship between checkout time and users. This showed that most riders returned the bikes around the 20 minute mark.

The second visualization showed that regardless of gender, the checkout times were very consistent.

The third visualization showed that most trips were taken between 5 PM and 7 PM, with another busy time between 7 AM and 9 AM.

This heatmap shows the same trend regarding times, broken down by gender. While there were a higher number of male riders overall, the same time blocks were busiest for both genders.

We were also able to review the top starting and ending locations for comparison, which showed that there were distinct areas of higher traffic for both start and stop locations.

## Summary
Overall, there were higher number of male riders showing potential marketing opportunities driven toward male users. Additionally, the weekday traffic was consistent between morning and afternoon rush hour times, while weekend usage was varied throughout the day. 
An additional analysis that could be run would be a comparison of trip duration between weekend trips vs weekday trips to understand the type of trip differences given the day of the week. One further piece that analysis could be done on would be the usage based on weather related events and how that affects the usage numbers, given the geographical area.
